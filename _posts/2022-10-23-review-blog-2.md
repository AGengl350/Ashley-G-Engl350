### Summary

This Digital Humanities project depicts the many haunted locations that occur in the United Kingdom. The site shows various data points with the name and a brief history of the haunted area. Additionally, states why it is listed as a haunted location on the map in the United Kingdom. They highlight a few of the more popular locations and give more extensive detail for the readers to look into more if desired. These details entail images of the physical location, images of the layout/blueprints of the locations and more in depth information about the history of the location instead of just a general summary. It is not an extensive project with multiple maps but it is very interesting to see how many haunted locations there are a vast amount of haunted areas in the United Kingdom.

### Humanistic Evidence

By using historical data of haunted locations  it helps to show the humanistic aspect of this project. The project attempts to include the location and the historical descriptions for each and every location. However, sometimes it falls short as it does not have historical information for all locations. By using the historical data on the map it helps to show the humanistic data within the map rather than throwing points on a map and saying they are all haunted locations and having a summary on a different part of the site. By just clicking on the point on the map it makes it easy for the viewer to see the historical information instead of just seeing a name and then having to go search for the information about the haunted location. For the few featured locations there are even videos of paranormal experts that have stayed at and reviewed the locations and the information from the videos aids in the humanistic aspect but being that there are videos imbedded in the site helps with the technological aspect of the site.

### Technology 

They used geographical mapping technology to take the historical information and implement it into a visual for users to see. By taking the historical information and using mapping they are able to show visually where the locations are on a map of the United Kingdom. This helps to engage viewers more instead of just reading list after list of haunted locations. By also including videos and other images it saves the viewer time from having to do more research if they wanted to see the location more. There are a lot of different data points that they used so this will definitely help people see locations that are more haunted geographically. From a technological standpoint, it is relatively easy to navigate as it is only one map but the lack of filters makes it slightly confusing and overwhelming. They used a very public and easily accessible site so that anyone from scholars, teachers, and every day people could see instead of making it specifically catered to one group. 


### Usability 

I really enjoyed how much data they were able to obtain. However, Something I noticed right away is that there are lots of haunted locations listed. This becomes quite overwhelming to an initial viewer who wants to know more about the haunted locations in the United Kingdom. Some ideas I had to help de-densify the map was to add filters. I think filters would greatly benefit in focusing specific areas instead of just a sea of locations. I would also advise to maybe take off the locations that just have a name and maybe make a small list on a different part of the site with the names of these locations to help reduce any unnecessary information from being shown because just having a point on the graph with no historical information about it seems to just clutter the map more. 

By using additional maps to then filter by type of haunting that could also greatly benefit those looking for murdered hauntings, demonic hauntings, etc. I was not a fan of how many ads would pop up on this site or that it didn’t really feel like the most reliable and trustworthy site considering that it looked more like a blog site than an academic one so refining the site could help to give it more of a sophisticated look. Overall, it is a very easy site to use but it could use some refinement to enhance it academically and make it less overwhelming. 

### Relatability 

My digital humanities project relates to the most haunted location in Virginia in the United States. I will also be observing historical data and mapping it similar to this project. However, since I am focused on one location, I am going to key in on making the data more detailed and make the map more interactive. I will do this by only adding map points for the locations that I could have information for. I would include links to sites within my summary description of the haunted location for those who want to dig deeper into the location as well as information and links to tours. 

An additional difference of my project would be that I am going to be having separate points relating to solely haunted attractions nearby those locations so that if people don’t want to go to a real haunted location they could opt for the more commercialized location nearby. 

My site will also have a map related to household income and where the sites are located near the higher or lower income areas. This would show if hauntings occur in lower income areas and what areas to avoid based on how much income you have to what you could afford to avoid if hauntings was a deciding factor in where someone wants to live. By viewing a similar digital humanities project to my own, I am able to see what I would do differently such as adding more filters to help with usability but also be inspired by using floor plans or images and videos which I had not thought of before.
