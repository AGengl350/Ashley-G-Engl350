### Summary

This Digital Humanities project depicts the many haunted locations that occur in the United Kingdom. The site shows various data points with the name and a brief history of the haunted area. Additionally, states why it is listed as a haunted location on the map in the United Kingdom. They highlight a few of the more popular locations and give more extensive detail for the readers to look into more if desired. These details entail images of the physical location, images of the layout/blueprints of the locations and more in depth information about the history of the location instead of just a general summary. It is not an extensive project with multiple maps but it is very interesting to see how many haunted locations there are a vast amount of haunted areas in the United Kingdom.
