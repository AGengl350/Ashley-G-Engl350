My name is Ashley and I am currently a senior at Christopher Newport University. I use the pronouns she/her. My major is in Finance with a minor in psychology. The field of finance was not always what I wanted to go into but with mathematics, budgeting, and preparing for the future always being a part of my life, I thought it was the most versatile major for my potential career. Psychology is a good minor to understanding how people think and behave which could help me understand people better in business settings. As my final semesters for college are approaching I need to still fulfill the writing intensive requirement to graduate.

When I put together my fall semester schedule, I realized I did not have an interest in any of the other writing intensive courses. The *Digital Humanities* The course came recommended by many of my peers. I have not always been the most proficient in my English classes in the past but being in the younger generation with more technological skills, I felt that I would thrive more in this class than other writing intensive courses.	

After taking this course with others and my final spring classes I will be able to graduate in May of 2023. After graduating this spring I will try to find a job immediately as I will be out on my own and need to support myself financially. While in this job, I will try to complete an online Masters in Financial Analysis to aid in the development and knowledge of my field but have the flexibility to still work fulltime.My ultimate career goal is to become a *Chief Financial Officer* of a company with an impact that lines up with my beliefs. A company that I really admire and would love to be the CFO for is Mission BBQ. They honor those who have served this country with amazing food.

Relating to [Mission BBQ](https://mission-bbq.com), I worked for them as a delivery driver this past summer to help out and make a little extra cash. Additionally, This past summer I was an intern at Argent Bridge Advisors, which is a financial planning firm who also aids in divorce planning. At my internship I did both Marketing and Finance work which was very fun and informative but I am not sure that I want to go into financial planning specifically.

My hometown is Herndon, VA located in northern VA. I made a lot of great memories and did three years of varsity cheerleading at my local high school, (our cheer team won states in 2012!) My favorite part of growing up was having my two English Mastiffs named Bailey and Cosmo. Sadly, in 2019, we lost Cosmo but Bailey is 11 yrs old now and still doing amazing. Recently, I moved into an apartment off-campus that is dog friendly so I adopted a german shepherd lab mix and named her Athena. Already, Athena and I have gone to the beach together, done hikes and plan on traveling and making more memories together.
