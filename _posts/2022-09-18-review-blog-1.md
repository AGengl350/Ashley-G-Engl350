### Summary

The project is primarily multiple interactive maps of the roughly 3,000 accused whiches in Scotland ranging from years 1550-1750. The site has different sections dedicated to the residences (the accused), residences with a timeline an ArcGIS graph for mainly male to female comparison, Residences within each parish (county), detention location, death location and many other types of interactive maps within the site. The site mainly just contains maps that show the data collected about the accused. Within each map there are filters relating to gender, social class, occupation and comparing a modern day map to historic map. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed how interactive this project was but wished that there were more filters instead of creating multiple graphs which can overwhelm the viewer.
