### Summary

### Humanistic Evidence

Historically, we can see what happened to many women and men who were accused of witchcraft in Scotland. They use graphical data as well as numerical data to show the viewer with different colors how many men, women and others were accused of being a witch. Social classes of each person accused can be helpful to see what they were known for at the time and if there was a trend of more of the lower social standing people being accused or if there were more nobles accused. This is very advanced considering that with new technology we are able to use the data from a long time ago to now map and show people who were never known before.

### Technological Evidence

From a technological standpoint, there are many data points used to create a visual representation of who was accused. Additionally, they used ArcGIS which is a form of data mapping. Instead of just reading data upon data, we get to visualize the data with the help of mapping. Not only does this help show the data, it is also relatively accessible to all. Being in a younger generation I was able to easily access all the data information. By using technology it can still be very academic but steer clear of just numbers and statistics on an academic journal and actually show the viewer and let them interact how they would like. The technology itself as a website was easy to navigate, however, maybe summaries of each map versus just a map title would have been a little bit more helpful in understanding the reasoning behind creating a certain map.

### Findings 

When it comes to the usability of the site, the filters so people can select certain characteristics to focus on but for social class and occupations it can be difficult to understand what each means because there is nothing on the site that describes the social classes or occupations of people in Scotland at the time so it does lack in that sense. 
When initially looking at the site, I noticed that I was only seeing a map and was very confused about if there were any words to describe the data. There was nothing mentioning a menu or different categories, it just had an interactive map, but there were 3 limes in the top corner that I ended up clicking on to get the menu options. It's common to use the three lines as a menu icon but maybe a word indicating that there are other parts to this site would be helpful. When I was able to get into the menu icon there were multiple different choices for different maps which was a little overwhelming. However, they did mention that this was a first attempt to geolocate this type of data and I do commend them for the amount of data that they were able to gather due to it being so long ago. 
An additional interesting factor was that they had an accessibility tab in which they characterize how they have helped to make their site better but also by describing where their downfalls have occurred. I really appreciate this because the project acknowledges that it has some downfalls instead of ignoring them. Overally, I love the visual representation of a time in history that many people do not know about but since it is still a young project there are a few parts like the benefit of having summaries and fewer individual maps that could help this project come together more.
