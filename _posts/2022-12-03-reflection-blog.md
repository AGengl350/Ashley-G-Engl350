## Course Review 

At the start of the course my idea and understanding of Digital Humanities was very limited. In the beginning, I believed it entailed technological aspects such as social media or websites and possibly some form of writing but there are so many more layers than I expected. 

Digital Humanities is very complex and can be defined in many different ways, there is no one correct definition of it as it is a newer form of humanities. There are many interactive aspects of a digital humanities project such as links, graphs, timelines, maps, etc. However, in order for it to be humanities it must have some sort of historical or cultural significance to the project such as a timeline of the civil war era. Now I have a much better understanding of the complexity and significance of digital humanities. 

## Reading Review 

The course readings were very helpful to the general understanding of the course to an extent. I feel that I gained more understanding from in class discussions or examples. But that being said, the readings gave me a basic understanding so that I could come into class with general knowledge about the topic before discussing it further as a class. In previous courses I have not been the best at holding myself accountable when it comes to completing reading assignments, but the weekly twitter posts helped out a lot.

I do not necessarily have a favorite reading but I definitely relate to the reading that discussed rough first drafts. Additionally, I do not think any of the readings should be skipped or not read as thoroughly because there was a reason that the professor chose that reading and it is to benefit the students in having a good understanding of the course material.

## Assignment Review 

I really enjoyed the ideation sheet for our grant project where we could bring our ideas to life. I love design and although I can't draw very well I really enjoyed using my ipad to create how I would have the website set up. Similarly, the overall grant project being the main aspect of the course helped to keep me on track and focus on one project instead of having multiple large projects we had a few small ones.

I was not a fan of the annotated bibliography but that is only due to having done so many in previous classes. The upside to this bibliography was being able to utilize sources that were not only academic peer reviewed ones. This helped me to get more ideas for my project. 

## Takeaway 

I think as a writer I have strengthened my skills especially when it comes to writing blog posts and other digital forms of writing. However, I feel that my reading skills have been pretty well maintained but have not necessarily grown. I enjoyed reading for this class because it was not long chapters of a book, it was interesting and shorter articles. Lastly, I appreciate everything that I have learned from this course and I hope to apply some of the things I have learned to my future.
